what is this in JavaScript it is the

object that is executing the current

function so without any context this

refers to the global object which in a

browser is the window what about in a

standard function this again refers to

the global object window since the

function is being executed from the

global object if we add use strict to

our code then we will prevent the

binding of this within the function but

notice that outside of the function this

still refers to the global window object

now let's look at an object method here

we have a user object with the method of

full name within the object this now

refers to the object in which it is

called in our first console.log we're

getting the entire object and in our

second log we are getting the first and

last name using our template string an

easy way to remember what this will

refer to is by looking at the line where

the function or method is called

whatever is to the left of the function

or method will be what this will bind to

this is another way to write the same

method here we are defining the function

but what if we use an arrow function

here instead it's important to

understand how arrow functions work

along with when to use them and not to

use them in this instance we would not

want to use an arrow function because

arrow functions always bind to the

global object this time in our first

console.log we get the window object and

in the second log we get undefined now

let's add an array of pets within the

user object and then a new method to

list each pet since we now know that in

this context this will refer to the

object we can use this dot pets for each

then we'll create a function and log

each pet but now what if we also want to

add the user's name before the pet so we

want it to say John's cat dog and fish

in this context within the for each

method we have another function which

does not bind

to the original object but to the global

object so in this instance since we are

using for each we can pass an argument

so we will pass in the original this

which refers to the object and now it

works as expected it's important to note

though that not every method supports

arguments lastly let's look at a

constructor function here we have a user

function that takes an argument of name

and then it assigns this name to that

name and then it logs this to initialize

the constructor function we create a

constant of new user which is equal to

new user and we pass it a name by using

new we are creating an object and now it

returns that object with the name that

we passed it if my videos have helped
